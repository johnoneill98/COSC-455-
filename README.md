# COSC-455 
This is all the code I used for all the projects in COSC 455
 Project 1: To tokening a give fiven file and implement a leume tale 
 Project 2: To make a parser to see if the experssions in the a file are syntactically correct 
 *Note* that eveythin must be spaced out invluding ()
 For example (b) wouldnt work but ( b ) would work
 Also, " True " would work but " true " would not work " 
 Same thing goes for False
